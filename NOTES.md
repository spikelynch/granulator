# TODO

- quantise playback speed to rational values
- display the playback and harmonics when quantised

- multiple grain buffers - TouchOsc interface to select which to send to
- play back all buffers?

- refactor for multitrack
  - which controls are per-track and which are global? sort these out in the UI
  - encapsulate a grainstrack in an object?

- auto-mix: base the mix level on how loud the incoming signal is so that tracks don't fade out

- fancier playback:
  - intertwine different rates and directions


- rhythm controls
  - number of steps in step granulator
  - modulate grain level in time with playback
  - sync LFOs to playback
